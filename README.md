Hi. Welcome to the repo for my personal website. I am currently working on creating a landing page with basic info about me and my skills. There is also a link to download a copy of my most current resume.
I will be adding a log that has the same articles I'm posting to Medium, as well as the preview version of my upcoming open-source educational website:
**JavaScript - The Little Things**

## To install:
