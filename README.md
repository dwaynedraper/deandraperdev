Hi. Welcome to the repo for my personal website. I am currently working on creating a landing page with basic info about me and my skills. There is also a link to download a copy of my most current resume.
I will be adding a log that has the same articles I'm posting to Medium, as well as the preview version of my upcoming open-source educational website: <br>
**JavaScript - The Little Things**

## JavaScript - The Little Things
JavaScript - The Little Things will be an application where users can sign up to offer tidbits of knowledge, learn from others. Topics will be organized by category.<br>

Too many tutorials go into the fundamentals and never touch on the 'little things' that you're expected to know. Instead of using long if blocks, just writing `isTrue && renderThis()`. How to reverse a string. The weird quirks in JavaScript, like `0 == []` being true, `0 == '0'` being true, but `'0' == []` being false. It all makes sense once you understand a few little things, but it's overwhelming to a newb, and there isn't really a single place where they can find all this info gathered in one place.<br>

Stack Overflow? That's occasionally hard to decipher as an experienced engineer, much less as a junior developer.<br>

Users will be able to submit posts in one of three different formats. The submission page will have fields and instructions that guide users on how to submit. The consistent format should make learning a topic a smooth experience. The three formats are as follows:<br>

* Little Things - a tutorial style guide covering a specific topic, with code and the thinking behind it.
* Common Problems - a problem that was encountered, along with the thinking behind it and how to fix it.
* Practice Problems - whiteboard-style problems that cover common areas of difficulty with revealable solutions.

I have a small notebook filled with probably 100 different examples to populate the site with a few for inspiration. I really hope that developers will share tutorials for the problems they've just faced, and that this will become a very comprehensive source of the Little Things of JavaScript.<br>

Help me make this a reality. Whether you want to help with developing this groundbreaking app for aspiring developers, or by offering your own Little Things, all help will be welcome!<br>
